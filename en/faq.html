          <p>Creating a Trendigo account is done from the Mobile App which can be downloaded to an
Android smartphone or iPhone. Some information is needed. You then receive an email with an
authentication code that you must enter in your mobile application. It’s that simple. To be able
to use your account, that is to say pay and receive cashback on your electronic wallets, you
must associate a bank card. The information is encrypted and made inaccessible.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="texte-reponse">
          <p>An account is never refused. However, it is possible that an account cannot be created for one
of the following reasons:
<br>- The address does not exist. This happens when the address is entered incorrectly. Check
spelling and postal code in particular.
<br>- The email is not valid. Account validation is done from an email sent to you to confirm your
identity. If the address is wrong or misspelled, you cannot receive it and therefore cannot
validate it.
<br>- There is no payment method associated with your account. To be effective, a Trendigo account
must be linked to a payment card. This does not prevent the creation of the account, but its use.
To remedy this, add a card and check, if you have one, that it is valid.
If you still can’t create your account, contact our customer support: xxx xxx xxxx.</p>

It is possible to create multiple accounts, but this is not necessary. It is not necessary to create
multiple Trendigo accounts, even if you are going to different merchants. The app handles
payments, cashback rewards and assigns them to merchants where you can use them. You don't
have to do anything except scan the QR code when checking out.
If you want to use multiple cards, no need to create multiple accounts. You can add as many
cards as you want and choose which one to pay with, including with each payment.</p>

          <p>All Trendigo customers have a main wallet on which the amounts received in cash-back
from merchants who are members of the Trendigo community are loaded. As the
Trendigo payment application is a universal payment method, it is also used to pay at
merchants, customer groups or franchises that accept this payment method. Each of
them has their own wallet that accumulates the amounts that can be spent at home.
You don't have to manage these wallets. Each time you want to pay, the application
informs you of the amount available at that merchant and asks if you want to use it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="texte-reponse">
          <p>The Trendigo payment application is a payment method that allows you to pay bills at
merchants that accept it. To use it, a customer must download the app to their
smartphone, create an account and add a payment card.<br>
To pay, you must press the "Pay" button at the bottom of the application pages and scan
the Trendigo QR Code at the merchant.
Two QR codes exist:
<br>- The unique code specific to the merchant.
<br>Scan the code.
<br>Enter the amount to pay in the page that opens, then, if applicable, the tip you
want to leave, choose the payment card (by default, the last used), use or not
Trendigo points.
<br>Confirm your payment.
<br>- The code created by the merchant on his phone.
<br>Scan the code on the merchant's phone, verify that the amount is correct, then, if
applicable, the tip you want to leave and press pay.
<br>With each payment, you can choose to use the cash back available in your wallet.
<br>The balance between the amount to be paid and the amount in the wallet is debited
from your card.</p>

        <div class="texte-reponse">
          <p>The payment code is generally well placed by the merchant in a visible and easily

phone and you will have to scan his QR code.</p>

          <p>Yes, this is completely normal. The trader has two possibilities. Either he uses his unique
code, or he generates a code for each payment. In this second case, he is the one who
enters the amount to be paid and presents his phone to you.</p>

For a customer, everything is transparent, and it is the application that manages the allocation and use of available amounts depending on the merchant's network.</p>

          <p>Trendigo is a dematerialized means of payment and loyalty. The payment terminal is in the mobile of your customers. A customer who wants to pay you will scan your unique QR code. In his application, he chooses the amount of the tip and initiates the transaction. You instantly know by a notification, an email confirming that it has been accepted. It is also added to the list of your transactions on the back-office dashboard page and in your merchant application (if you choose to use it). This customer receives a percentage of his invoice in cashback (if activated) that he can reuse for a future payment. You determine the amount of cashback. The money from your transactions minus the transaction fees goes directly to your bank account. You keep the cashback amount, and your customer can use it when he chooses.

          <p>The Trendigo community is made up of all merchants and customers who have chosen to accept trendigo payments. It is based on discovering local shops and helping local businesses. A merchant or a private network of merchants (shopping center, association of businesses, franchise) can choose the trendigo loyalty plan. The cash-back given to their customers can be used only at their locations. Customers will still be able to pay at other Trendigo stores, but will not be able to use their rewards elsewhere.
